# Using Information Theory to Characterize Prosodic Typology

This project explores fastText, mGPT, mBERT and a C-KDE way with no LLMs to predict the lexical identity of a word from its prosody.
We then use the information-theoretic measure of entropy to quantify the amount of information that prosody conveys about lexical identity. 

---

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Setup
```bash
conda create --name prosody python=3.10
conda activate prosody
conda install -r requirements.txt
```
Or you can install the requirements with environment.yaml file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

---
## Data
### Download the already prepared prominence dataset:
```bash
cd data
git clone https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/prosody.git
```

### Download the Common Voice dataset used in this project:
You can download the Common Voice dataset from the [Common Voice website](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en).

### Prepare the Common Voice dataset:
You need to preprocess the Common Voice dataset to extract the prosodic features. You can use the following script to extract the prosodic features:
1. MFA (Montreal Forced Aligner) to align the audio files with the text files. Tutorial by Eleanor Chodroff: [link](https://lingmethodshub.github.io/content/tools/mfa/mfa-tutorial/) the MFA tool: [link](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
2. You can extract the prosodic features f0 using the `extract.py` script, and prominence features using the `extract_prominence.py` script. For other prosodic features, you can change the arguments in the `extract.py` script.
Or run the bash script f0_extraction.sh in your server to extract the f0 features.

## Running the experiments
We followed the models in the project [Quantifying the redundancy between prosody and text](https://github.com/lu-wo/quantifying-redundancy?tab=readme-ov-file) and enhanced the performance by adapting the Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) method in this repository: [CDE](https://github.com/freelunchtheorem/Conditional_Density_Estimation). Please also see the documentation for more information: [CDE Documentation](https://freelunchtheorem.github.io/Conditional_Density_Estimation/docs/html/index.html).

### 1. Model training and conditional entropy estimation
All the bash script for training the models are in the `scripts` folder. In the `baselines` subfolder, you can find the bash scripts for using the fastText models with CDE.
In the `mGPT` subfolder, you can find the bash scripts for using the mGPT models with CDE. In the `mBERT` subfolder, you can find the bash scripts for using the mBERT models with CDE. 
In the `notebooks` folder, you can find the bash scripts for using the C-KDE-all and C-KDE-split models.

### 2. KDE and differential entropy estimation
In the `notebooks` folder, you can find the scripts for using the KDE and Monte Carlo sampling for differential entropy estimation.
